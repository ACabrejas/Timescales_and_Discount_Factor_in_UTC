# Timescales_and_Discount_Factor_in_UTC
Looking into the relevance of \gamma (discount factor) in RL applied to Urban Traffic Control, investigating the relationship between it and the natural timescales in which the state variables vary.
The research itself is incomplete due to the funding ending, but there are different agents and models here that may be of use for other researchers.
Feel free to contact for information on how to use them.
